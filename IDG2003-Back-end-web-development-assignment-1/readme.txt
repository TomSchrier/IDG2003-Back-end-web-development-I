---HOW TO USE IT---

*To get started, upload a CSV-file on the Upload.php page. (I have been 
using the data.csv file located in 'uploads\data.csv' while testing) It shows 
the uploaded data (like lab 5). It should also populate the other 
databases: studentsDatabase.csv, coursesDatabase.csv, and 
courseTakenDatabase.csv). It is not possible to visit students.php and course.php
to look at the information stored in these databases.


---KNOW THINGS---

*The CourseTaken data is currently only appended at the end of the file each time as it does
not search for duplicates.

*The courses.php is only partially complete as it is not necessary to pass as discussed on MS Teams.

*The long comments in the code are a pain in the ass to read, but I hope they help explain how things work.
